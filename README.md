Concept demo that doesn't do much right now. The idea is that it overlays a button to add an article/artefact to a list on Sciety. Inspired by the UI for [Folk CRM](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/folkx/akeepikolhaikilagiekmegfhefcbohd?hl=en)

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Select **Load Unpacked** and navigate to the folder that these files are in

3. Navigate to a preprint on bioRxiv (only for now)
4. Click **Add to Sciety** button
5. View saved articles in the extension menu
